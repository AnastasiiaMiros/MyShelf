# MyShelf
My uni project. It's an Android application for book tracking (plan to add other types of media too).

Uses OpenLibrary RESTful API for book searching; Retrofit2 and Moshi for receiving/converting json; Room and SQLite to save data localy; Compose for UI.

## Features
* Search books in OpenLibrary database
* Save books to lists (Wishlist, Reading, Finished)
* Add personal notes for saved books
